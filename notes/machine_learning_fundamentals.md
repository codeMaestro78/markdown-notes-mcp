# Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This guide covers the core concepts, algorithms, and practical applications.

## ðŸŽ¯ What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act like humans do, and improve their learning over time in autonomous fashion, by feeding them data and information in the form of observations and real-world interactions.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Learning from Data**: Algorithms improve performance as they process more data
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify patterns and relationships in data
- **Adaptability**: Models can adapt to new data without explicit reprogramming
- **Scalability**: Handle large volumes of data efficiently

## ðŸ“Š Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
Learning from labeled training data to make predictions on unseen data.

#### Common Algorithms:
- **Linear Regression**: Predict continuous values
- **Logistic Regression**: Binary classification
- **Decision Trees**: Tree-based classification and regression
- **Random Forest**: Ensemble of decision trees
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Maximum margin classification
- **Neural Networks**: Deep learning models

#### Applications:
- Email spam detection
- Credit scoring
- Medical diagnosis
- Stock price prediction

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Finding hidden patterns in data without labeled examples.

#### Common Algorithms:
- **K-Means Clustering**: Group similar data points
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Build cluster hierarchies
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction
- **Association Rules**: Find frequent itemsets (Apriori, FP-Growth)
- **Gaussian Mixture Models**: Probabilistic clustering
- **Autoencoders**: Neural network for dimensionality reduction

#### Applications:
- Customer segmentation
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation systems
- Topic modeling

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
Learning through interaction with environment to maximize rewards.

#### Key Concepts:
- **Agent**: Decision-making entity
- **Environment**: System the agent interacts with
- **State**: Current situation of the agent
- **Action**: Choices available to the agent
- **Reward**: Feedback from the environment

#### Algorithms:
- **Q-Learning**: Value-based learning
- **SARSA**: On-policy temporal difference learning
- **Deep Q Networks (DQN)**: Deep reinforcement learning
- **Policy Gradient Methods**: Direct policy optimization

#### Applications:
- Game playing (AlphaGo, Atari games)
- Robotics control
- Autonomous vehicles
- Resource management

## ðŸ§® Model Evaluation Metrics

### Classification Metrics:
- **Accuracy**: (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
- **Precision**: TP / (TP + FP)
- **Recall**: TP / (TP + FN)
- **F1-Score**: 2 Ã— (Precision Ã— Recall) / (Precision + Recall)
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve

### Regression Metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute prediction errors
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared prediction errors
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of MSE
- **RÂ² Score**: Proportion of variance explained by the model

### Clustering Metrics:
- **Silhouette Score**: Measure of cluster cohesion and separation
- **Calinski-Harabasz Index**: Ratio of between-cluster to within-cluster variance
